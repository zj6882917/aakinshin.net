When you write some multithreading magic on .NET,
  you can use a cool synchronization primitive called [Mutex](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.mutex(v=vs.110).aspx):
```cs
var mutex = new Mutex(false, "Global\\MyNamedMutex");
```

You also can make it [named](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f55ddskf(v=vs.110).aspx) (and share the mutex between processes)
  which works perfectly on Windows:

<div class="mx-auto">
  <img class="mx-auto d-block" width="600" src="/img/posts/dotnet/namedmutex-on-mono/front.png" />
</div>

However, today the .NET Framework is cross-platform, so this code should work on any operation system.
What will happen if you use named mutex on Linux or MacOS with the help of Mono or CoreCLR?
Is it possible to create some tricky bug based on this case?
Of course, it does.
Today I want to tell you a story about such bug in [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) which was a headache for several weeks.

### Preamble

The easiest way to avoid troubles with named mutex is the following: don't use them at all.
However, it's not always possible because you may use 3rd party libraries that use named mutex.
Recently, we had such situation in Rider.
We used [NuGet.Client-3.4.3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.Client/3.4.3) which contained the `Settings.LoadDefaultSettings` method.
This method reads the content of the [NuGet.Config](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/configuring-nuget-behavior) files with useful information about package feeds and some other NuGet settings.
Of course, other threads or processes can also write to this file (or read from it) at the same time.
So, we have to protect the access to `NuGet.Config` with a synchronization primitive.
NuGet.Client-3.4.3 uses a named mutex for this purpose.
It worked fine in Rider when you used it as a client application.
We also have many integration tests for the NuGet logic and run them on [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) after each commit.
Sometimes, one of these tests was failing on Linux with the following exception:

```

It was awful because we couldn't obtain a permanent green build status.
Here is the [origin](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/58bd2dffe9cee8bf62b601f1610df4e9bbb91106/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Configuration/Settings/Settings.cs#L1134) of this exception:

``` cs
// Global: ensure mutex is honored across TS sessions 
using (var mutex = new Mutex(false, $"Global\\{EncryptionUtility.GenerateUniqueToken(fileName)}"))
{
    var owner = false;
    try
    {
        // operations on NuGet.config should be very short lived
        owner = mutex.WaitOne(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1));
        // decision here is to proceed even if we were not able to get mutex ownership
        // and let the potential IO errors bubble up. Reasoning is that failure to get
        // ownership probably means faulty hardware and in this case it's better to report
        // back than hang
        ioOperation();
    }
```

It seems that the culprit is a named mutex.

### Investigation

We have a bug in NuGet here, so I created an issue: [NuGet/Home#2860](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/2860).
This bug is based on a Mono bug with named mutex.
It was almost impossible to reproduce bug locally, so we started to try to create a minimal repro.
After a few weeks (yep, it wasn't easy), we finally did it (here is the bug report: [bugzilla.xamarin#41914](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41914)):
```cs
internal class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var a = "";
        for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        {
            new Thread(Crasher).Start();
        }
        Console.WriteLine(a);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }

    private static void Crasher()
    {
        var rnd = new Random();
        while (true)
        {
            Thread.Sleep(rnd.Next(100, 10000));
            using (var mutex = new Mutex(false, "Global\\TEST"))
            {
                var owner = false;
                try
                {
                    owner = mutex.WaitOne(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1));
                }
                finally
                {
                    if (owner)
                    {
                        mutex.ReleaseMutex();
                    }
                }
                Console.WriteLine("PING");
            }
            Thread.Sleep(rnd.Next(100, 10000));
        }
    }
}
```

So, we have troubles with both NuGet and Mono. Let's talk about each bug story.

### NuGet
After a few weeks, we received a useful [comment](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/2860#issuecomment-228174849) by [@migueldeicaza](https://github.com/migueldeicaza):
> Named mutexes in Mono are process-local, they are not global like they are on Windows, so on the Mono case, it should use the same setup.
> In the past, many years ago, mono supported global mutexes across a processes in the user namespace, but that support was very brittle and we removed the code some 4-5 years ago.

The first idea was to avoid named mutexes.
It was implemented in [NuGet/NuGet.Client#720](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/720):
  NuGet uses a named mutex only on Windows;
  otherwise, it uses a process-wide global mutex.
However, it wasn't a perfect solution because our global mutex isn't shared between processes.
So, this commit was reverted and replaced by another approach:
  [NuGet/NuGet.Client#725: use a common locking mechanism (filestream) for all platforms while writing to settings file](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/725).
A [comment](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/725#issue-163279546) by [@rohit21agrawal](https://github.com/rohit21agrawal):
> This makes use of a synchronized version of file locking by acquiring a filestream handle on a lock file.
> This approach works across all platforms and can do inter-process synchronization too.

You can find the current implementation in the [NuGet.Client-4.0.0-rc4/ConcurrencyUtilities.cs](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/release-4.0.0-rc4/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Common/ConcurrencyUtilities.cs) file.
Thus, the issue was resolved.
Due to the fact that we always try to use the latest published version of [NuGet.Client](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client),
  our integration tests were fixed after a dependencies update.
However, there is still a bug in Mono which should also be fixed.

### Mono
As I mentioned before, we create an [issue](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41914) in mono bug tracking system (2016-06-16).
Over time (2016-09-14), it was fixed
  ([mono/mono#3560: [w32handle] Fix race condition when creating named mutex/event/semaphore](https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/3560));
  the most interesting changes are in the [w32handle.c](https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/3560/files#diff-2fa9d2ef24b4fd347ae97a87829a5f59).
So, we don't have the described race condition anymore.
However, mutexes in Mono are still process-local, you can't use it across processes.
Also, the MOBILE profile does not support named mutexes at all: [mono-4.6.2.16/Mutex.cs#L164](https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/mono-4.6.2.16/mcs/class/corlib/System.Threading/Mutex.cs#L164),
 it just throws a [NotSupportedException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.notsupportedexception(v=vs.110).aspx)
 (see also [bugzilla.xamarin#26067](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=26067)).
Be careful!

### CoreCLR
Mono is not the only xplat .NET runtime; we also have [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr)!
How are things going with named mutexes on Linux and MacOS here?

Early versions of CoreCLR just throw a [PlatformNotSupportedException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.platformnotsupportedexception(v=vs.110).aspx)
  when users try to create named primitives (see [coreclr#1387](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/1387), [corefx#2796](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/2796)).
It wasn't great because there is a lot of legacy code which already uses named mutexes.
So, after some discussions
  (e.g., see [coreclr#1237](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/1237), [coreclr#3422](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/3422)),
  the cross-process named mutexes were implemented.
Here is an awesome PR by [@kouvel](https://github.com/kouvel): [coreclr#5030](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/5030).
A fragment from the issue summary:
> * On systems that support pthread process-shared robust recursive mutexes, they will be used
> * On other systems, file locks are used. File locks unfortunately don't have a timeout in the blocking wait call, and I didn't find any other sync object with a timed wait with the necessary properties, so polling is done for timed waits.

### Conclusion
When you write cross-platform .NET applications, think twice before using any OS-specific API.
Always check how it's implemented on your favorite runtime (Mono or CoreCLR).
Even if you are sure that *your code* is completely cross-platform,
  you still should be ready that there are some xplat bugs in libraries which you are using
  (especially if these libraries were originally written for Windows + the full .NET Framework).
Don't forget about unit and integration tests for multithreading code which execute your methods under load.
And make sure that your CI build server runs these tests on all target operation systems.
